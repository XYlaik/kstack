# Security Policy

## Supported versions

The latest released version receives security updates. Older versions may not be patched.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately:

- Email: open a security advisory via GitHub (Security tab) or contact the maintainer privately.
- Do not open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive reports.

Provide as much detail as possible:

- Affected version and environment
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Suggested fixes if known

We aim to acknowledge within a few business days and keep you updated on progress.
